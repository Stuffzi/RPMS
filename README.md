Realtime monitor of commercial power reactors in the United States. Shows reactor power, history, and incident reports.

Written in Java, meant to be cross-platform as much as possible. Make sure to use most recent JRE!

Gets a live update from the NRC every day at 5 am EST. If wanted, it can run in the background and build a history for your viewing needs.

Meant to also be used in more static applications like dedicated monitors.

This is under the MIT license for a reason. Feel free to derive my work or use parts of it, as long as you credit me. Thanks!
